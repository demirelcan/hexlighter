Hexlighter
==========

Hexlighter is a hex/binary black box analysis tool. Its aim is to facilitate
visualisation of raw hex dumps and differences between them.

It is mostly suited to black box protocol analysis.

For now, it only works on hex strings. Some samples are available in `samples`.
Some more interesting examples will come.
